    "# Louvain Community Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "The Louvain method of community detection is a greedy heirarical clsutering algorithm which seeks to optimize Modularity as it progresses. Louvain starts with each vertex in its own clusters and iteratively merges groups using graph contraction.  \n",

    "For a detailed description of the algorithm see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvain_Modularity\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes as input a cugraph.Graph object and returns as output a \n",
