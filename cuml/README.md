* `coordinate_descent_demo`: This notebook includes code examples of lasso and elastic net models. These models are placed together so a comparison between the two can also be made in addition to their sklearn equivalent.
* `dbscan_demo`: notebook showcasing density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (dbscan) algorithm comparison between cuML and scikit-learn.
* `linear_regression_demo`: notebook showcasing linear regression comparison between cuML and scikit-learn.
* `nearest_neighbors_demo`: notebook showcasing k-nearest neighbors (knn) algorithm comparison between cuML and scikit-learn.
* `pca_demo`: notebook showcasing principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm comparison between cuML and scikit-learn.
* `ridge_regression_demo`: notebook showcasing ridge regression comparison between cuML and scikit-learn.
* `sgd_demo`: notebook showcasing stochastic gradient descent comparison between cuML and scikit-learn.
* `tsvd_demo`: notebook showcasing truncated singular value decomposition (tsvd) algorithm comparison between cuML and scikit-learn.
* `umap_demp`: notebook showcasing and evaluating cuML's UMAP dimension reduction technique.
* `umap_demo_graphed`: Demonstration of cuML uniform manifold approximation & projection algorithm's supervised approach against mortgage dataset and comparison of results against the original author's equivalent non-GPU \Python implementation.
* `umap_supervised`: Demostration of UMAP supervised training. Uses a set of labels to perform supervised dimensionality reduction. UMAP can also be trained on datasets with incomplete labels, by using a label of "-1" for unlabeled samples.
