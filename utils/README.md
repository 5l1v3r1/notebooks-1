# Utility Scripts

## Quick Start

* `conda-create-cudf.sh`: creates a conda environment named `cudf` with all of the requisite software dependencies for [cuDF](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf)
* `start-jupyter.sh`: starts a JupyterLab environment for interacting with, and running, notebooks
* `stop-jupyter.sh`: identifies all process IDs associated with Jupyter and kills them
* `dask-cluster.py`: launches a configured Dask cluster (a set of nodes) for use within a notebook
* `dask-setup.sh`: a low-level script for constructing a set of Dask workers on a single node
