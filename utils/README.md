# Utility Scripts

## Quick Summary

* `conda-create-cudf.sh`: creates a conda environment named `cudf` with all of the requisite software dependencies for [cuDF](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf)
* `start-jupyter.sh`: starts a JupyterLab environment for interacting with, and running, notebooks
* `stop-jupyter.sh`: identifies all process IDs associated with Jupyter and kills them
* `dask-cluster.py`: launches a configured Dask cluster (a set of nodes) for use within a notebook
* `dask-setup.sh`: a low-level script for constructing a set of Dask workers on a single node ... **do not use this script directly**

## conda-create-cudf

Typical output (suppressing package plans) will be of the following form:

```bash
notebooks$ bash utils/conda-create-cudf.sh

attempting to remove current conda environment cudf

Remove all packages in environment /conda/envs/cudf:

...

creating dev environment for cudf

...

successfully created environment cudf

```

Activate the dev environment with 

```bash
$ source activate cudf
```

## start-jupyter

Typical output for `start-jupyter.sh` will be of the following form:

```bash

jupyter-lab --allow-root --ip=0.0.0.0 --no-browser --NotebookApp.token=''


[I 09:58:01.481 LabApp] Writing notebook server cookie secret to /run/user/10060/jupyter/notebook_cookie_secret
[W 09:58:01.928 LabApp] All authentication is disabled.  Anyone who can connect to this server will be able to run code.
[I 09:58:01.945 LabApp] JupyterLab extension loaded from /conda/envs/cudf/lib/python3.6/site-packages/jupyterlab

[I 09:58:01.949 LabApp] JupyterLab extension loaded from /conda/envs/cudf/lib/python3.6/site-packages/jupyterlab
[I 09:58:01.949 LabApp] JupyterLab application directory is /conda/envs/cudf/share/jupyter/lab
[I 09:58:01.950 LabApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /workspace/notebooks/notebooks
[I 09:58:01.950 LabApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at:
[I 09:58:01.950 LabApp] http://(dgx15 or 127.0.0.1):8888/
[I 09:58:01.950 LabApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).
```

`jupyter-lab` will expose a JupyterLab server on port `:8888`. Opening a web-browser, and navigating to `http://YOUR.IP.ADDRESS:8888` provides a GUI which can used to edit/run code.

## stop-jupyter

Sometimes a server needs to be forcibly shut down. Running 

```bash
notebooks$ bash utils/stop-jupyter.sh
```

will kill any and all JupyterLab servers running on the machine.

## dask-cluster

This is a Python script used to launch a Dask cluster. A configuration file is provided at `/path/to/notebooks/utils/dask.conf`.

```bash
notebooks$ cat utils/dask.conf

NWORKERS 8

12.34.567.890 MASTER

DASK_SCHED_PORT         8786
DASK_SCHED_BOKEH_PORT   8787
DASK_WORKER_BOKEH_PORT  8790
```

* `NWORKERS 8`: a keyword to tell `dask-cluster.py` how many workers to instantiate on the node which called `dask-cluster.py`
* `12.34.567.890 MASTER`: a map of `IP.ADDRESS {WORKER/MASTER}`
* `DASK_SCHED_PORT         8786`: a keyword to tell `dask-cluster.py` which port is assigned to the Dask scheduler
* `DASK_SCHED_BOKEH_PORT   8787`: a keyword to tell `dask-cluster.py` which port is assigned to the scheduler's visual front-end
* `DASK_WORKER_BOKEH_PORT  8790`: a keyword to tell `dask-cluster.py` which port is assigned to the worker's visual front-end

## dask-setup

`dask-setup.sh` expect several inputs, and order matters:

* `NWORKERS`: number of workers to create
* `DASK_SCHED_PORT`: port to assign the scheduler
* `DASK_SCHED_BOKEH_PORT`: port to assign the scheduler's front-end
* `DASK_WORKER_BOKEH_PORT`: port to assign the worker's front-end
* `YOUR.IP.ADDRESS`: machine's IP address
* `{WORKER/MASTER}`: the node's title
* `DEBUG`: log-level (optional, case-sensitive)

The script is called like follows:

```bash
notebooks$ bash utils/dask-setup.sh 8 8786 8787 8790 12.34.567.890 MASTER DEBUG
```

Note: `DEBUG` is optional. This script was designed to be called by `dask-cluster.py`. It is not meant to be called directly by a user other than to kill all present Dask workers:

```bash
notebooks$ bash utils/dask-setup.sh 0
```
